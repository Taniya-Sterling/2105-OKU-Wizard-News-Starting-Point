  content: "'You’re a little far from home aren’t ya?' Those words were spoken by Gabrielle Dubois, A Gotham city native and a witness to the Toyman’s attempted robbery of a Bank. One week ago Metropolis’ own Toyman attempted to rob the June and Patterson bank on 76th street in Gotham City…his attempt was swiftly halted by many brave civilians. Eyewitnesses report nearly every single able-bodied man and woman pelting the Toymaker -who was atop the car he used to ram the building- until he fell to ground, after the tumble bystanders the proceeded to knock the Toymaker unconscious. No one was harmed aside the Toymaker who was taken away with severe injuries, when interviewing college student Majorie Major she stated.'It’s Gotham, being outside after sundown is dangerous so you gotta know how to protect yourself, taking down a Metropolis villain is easy when compared to running from killer croc' Once again Gotham has proven themselves a dangerous city with dangerous villains and even more dangerous civilians living in it.",
